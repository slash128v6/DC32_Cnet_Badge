### Step 5: Apply first LED

Line up the LED strip pads on the badge pads leaving the ends of the badge pads exposed so you can heat them up with your soldering iron. It‚Äôs a little tricky but you should be able to get the solder to flow and insert some solder from the sides of the pads to connect the pads. Try to keep the LED strip straight.

### Step 19: Speaker Wire

Trim the speaker wires leaving a few inches and run the speaker wires through the holes as shown for strain relief 

![](./images/Picture19.jpg)

### Step 20: Tape Speakers

Cut two pieces of double-sided foam for speaker mounting (leave enough for a third piece for battery mounting)

![](./images/Picture20.jpg)

### Step 21: Attach Speakers

Mount the speakers to the badge using the foam tape by standing the badge and speakers upraight before pressing them together so it balances and doesn‚Äôt tip over

### Step 22: Speaker Wires

Split and trim the speaker wires to solder to the badge

### Step 23: Solder Speaker Wires

Solder the speaker wires to the badge noting polarity ‚Äì red to (+) and black to (-)

### Step 24: Power pigtail

Locate the JST PH 1.25 and JST PH 2.0 pigtail leads and 1 piece of heat shrink

![](./images/Picture24.jpg)

### Step 25: Polarity Check

_***Important!***_

Verify Polarity!

Due to a part change with the JST PH 2.0 pigtail please confirm that the wires are in the correct position matching the photo above. If they are opposite then you need to swap them around by carefully lifting up the plastic tabs with tweezers, removing each wire, then slide them back in to the opposite side. 

**ASK IF YOU NEED HELP WITH THIS. PERFORMING THIS STEP INCORRECTLY WILL DAMAGE YOUR BADGE AND COULD BE A FIRE HAZZARD. 

PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!**

### Step 26: Pigtail

Slip the 2 pieces of heat shrink onto the JST PH 2.0 pig tail (fatter wires), then strip and tin the ends

### Step 27: Solder the Cables

Solder the wires together RED to RED and BLACK to BLACK, a set of ‚Äúhelping hands‚Äù can be helpful üòä

### Step 29: Badge Adhesive

Place the last piece if the double sided tape in the battery location on the back of the badge

![](./images/Picture29.jpg)

### Step 30: Battery Leads

Route the battery leads using the pigtail connector, the leads can be tucked under the edges of the battery.

**Verify polarity is correct before connecting. If you're not sure, please ask.**
