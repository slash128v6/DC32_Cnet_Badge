### Step 5: Apply first LED

Line up the LED strip pads on the badge pads leaving the ends of the badge pads exposed so you can heat them up with your soldering iron. Itâ€™s a little tricky but you should be able to get the solder to flow and insert some solder from the sides of the pads to connect the pads. Try to keep the LED strip straight.
