## Description
The **Fony Bitman** by CompuNet is a cutting-edge, compact, and highly versatile device designed to seamlessly integrate with modern lifestyles. This device harnesses the robust capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller, known for its high performance, low power consumption, and advanced wireless connectivity features.

*Key Features:*

Arduino-based ESP32 Microcontroller: At its core, the **Fony Bitman** features Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, as well as high-fidelity mono sound with redundant output (a second speaker).

Customizable and Expandable: The **Fony Bitman** by CompuNet is highly customizable, allowing developers to create tailored applications and features. Its expandable nature supports various sensors and modules, enhancing functionality for specific use cases. If you don't like how it works, re-engineer accordingly.

This device is not UL listed, certified, warranteed or recommended for anyone that is adverse to sharp, dangerous objects. As with all electronics projects, unplug when not in use and store safely to avoid fires, spontanious combustion, itching or burning sensations. 

Do not taunt the **Fony Bitman**.

## Badge Operation

The power switch selects battery power or USB power. USB power will charge the battery. The battery must be sufficiently charged for battery operation. If the badge does not operate on battery power let it charge via USB. There is a battery ‚Äúgas gauge‚Äù on the charge module that is viewable from the front of the board.

From your phone connect to Bluetooth device ‚ÄúFONY BITMAN‚Äù. Sound should play through the speakers and the LED strips should react to the music. The touch pads on the top front of the badge should act as music and volume controls.

### Step 4: Tin the LED & badge pads

![](./images/Picture4.jpg)

### Step 5: Apply first LED

Line up the LED strip pads on the badge pads leaving the ends of the badge pads exposed so you can heat them up with your soldering iron. It‚Äôs a little tricky but you should be able to get the solder to flow and insert some solder from the sides of the pads to connect the pads. Try to keep the LED strip straight.

### Step 9: Battery Charger Module

Locate the battery charger module and pin header and cut off 6 pins

![](./images/Picture9.jpg)

### Step 10: Solder the module header

Solder the 6 pin header to the charge module with the short pins protruding through the white silkscreen side of the charge module

![](./images/Picture10.jpg)

### Step 11: Attach module to the badge

Solder the charge module to the back of the badge

![](./images/Picture11.jpg)

### Step 12: Verify LED visibility

The charge module battery level LEDs should be visibile through the front of the badge

![](./images/Picture12.jpg)

### Step 13: Amplifier module

Locate the amplifier module and pin header, the green screw terminal is not needed and can be discarded

![](./images/Picture13.jpg)

### Step 14: Solder amp header

Solder the pin header to the amplifier with the short side of the pins protruding through the silkscreen pin label side of the amplifier module

![](./images/Picture14.jpg)

### Step 15: Attach pins to speaker outs

15)	Cut 2 more single pins and solder them to the speaker outputs with the short side protruding through the silkscreen pin label side of the amplifier module

### Step 18: Battery Connector

Solder the battery connector to the back of the badge

![](./images/Picture18.jpg)

### Step 19: Speaker Wire

Trim the speaker wires leaving a few inches and run the speaker wires through the holes as shown for strain relief 

![](./images/Picture19.jpg)

### Step 20: Tape Speakers

Cut two pieces of double-sided foam for speaker mounting (leave enough for a third piece for battery mounting)

![](./images/Picture20.jpg)

### Step 21: Attach Speakers

Mount the speakers to the badge using the foam tape by standing the badge and speakers upraight before pressing them together so it balances and doesn‚Äôt tip over

![](./images/Picture21.jpg)

### Step 22: Speaker Wires

Split and trim the speaker wires to solder to the badge

![](./images/Picture22.jpg)

![](./images/Picture22b.jpg)

### Step 23: Solder Speaker Wires

Solder the speaker wires to the badge noting polarity ‚Äì red to (+) and black to (-)

![](./images/Picture23.jpg)

![](./images/Picture23b.jpg)

### Step 24: Power pigtail

Locate the JST PH 1.25 and JST PH 2.0 pigtail leads and 1 piece of heat shrink

![](./images/Picture24.jpg)

### Step 25: Polarity Check

_***Important!***_

Verify Polarity!

Due to a part change with the JST PH 2.0 pigtail please confirm that the wires are in the correct position matching the photo above. If they are opposite then you need to swap them around by carefully lifting up the plastic tabs with tweezers, removing each wire, then slide them back in to the opposite side. 

**ASK IF YOU NEED HELP WITH THIS. PERFORMING THIS STEP INCORRECTLY WILL DAMAGE YOUR BADGE AND COULD BE A FIRE HAZZARD. 

PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!**

### Step 26: Pigtail

Slip the 2 pieces of heat shrink onto the JST PH 2.0 pig tail (fatter wires), then strip and tin the ends

![](./images/Picture26.jpg)

### Step 27: Solder the Cables

Solder the wires together RED to RED and BLACK to BLACK, a set of ‚Äúhelping hands‚Äù can be helpful üòä

![](./images/Picture27.jpg)

### Step 28: Apply Heatshrink

![](./images/Picture28.jpg)

### Step 29: Badge Adhesive

Place the last piece if the double sided tape in the battery location on the back of the badge

![](./images/Picture29.jpg)

### Step 30: Battery Leads

Route the battery leads using the pigtail connector, the leads can be tucked under the edges of the battery.

**Verify polarity is correct before connecting. If you're not sure, please ask.**
